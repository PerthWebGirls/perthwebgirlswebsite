              <b>How much does the workshop cost?</b> Nothing, it's free! You just need to be excited!
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Who is this aimed for?</b> Women of any age with basic knowledge of working with a computer. We’ve had people of all ages taking part. Please bring your laptop.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              <b>Do I need to know anything technical?</b> No - this is a workshop designed for beginners. As long as you have a vague understanding of how a computer works, we can teach you the rest! There will be plenty of Rails and Django mentors on hand across the weekend to help out with any questions you have.

            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Do I need to bring my own computer?</b> Yes you do, we don't have laptops spare unfortunately.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              I have a MacBook - is this ok?</b> Yes, the programs run on all kinds of operating systems so this is not a problem!
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Can men attend?</b> Yes, though women are given priority. You also need to bring an interested woman along. Men will be advised a few days out from the event if their registration was accepted.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              I know how to program - can I help?</b> Yippee! We’re also looking for people to be mentors, so if you would like to offer your time and skills, we would love to have you.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Where is this being held?</b> The event will be held at Spacecubed - 45 St Georges Tce Perth. On Friday night, all participants will meet on the ground floor for the introduction and install-a-thon. On the Saturday Rails participants will stay on the Ground Floor while Django girls will head upstairs to Level 9.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Do I need to bring my lunch?</b> No, the event is fully catered thanks to our awesome sponsors. Please let us know any dietary requirements/preferences you have though so we can work around this.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"><b>
              Do I need something fancy installed on my computer?</b> No - we will be having an install-a-thon on Friday night to get you all set up with everything you need. Mentors will be on hand to make sure all goes smoothly.
